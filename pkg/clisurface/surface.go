// Walk derives the surface of the tree rooted at root.

// Inherited flags are recorded per command, because inheritance alone does not
// make a flag usable: a command's PreRunE may reject a flag it inherits. Walk
// discovers those rejections by probing PreRunE (see probeRejections) rather
// than from a hand-maintained table, so removing the guard in the command
// changes the surface and reddens the gate.
//
// Walk does not mutate the observable tree. That is a hard requirement, not a
// nicety: a cobra tree is usually a package-level variable shared by every test
// in a binary, so any mutation leaks into whatever runs next. In particular Walk
// never calls cobra's LocalFlags or InheritedFlags accessors — both call
// mergePersistentFlags, which permanently folds every ancestor's persistent
// flags into the command's own FlagSet — and it never flips a Changed bit on a
// real flag (see resolveFlags and probeRejections).
//
// One cobra-internal write is unavoidable and harmless: cmd.Commands() sorts a
// command's child slice in place when cobra.EnableCommandSorting is set (the
// default), which is the only way to enumerate children. It is the same sort
// cobra performs itself before printing help, it is idempotent, and the slice is
// unexported — every route to it calls Commands() and therefore sorts first — so
// no caller can observe the difference. Toggling the package-level
// EnableCommandSorting to avoid it would be a data race with any parallel test.
//
// Only PreRunE is probed. A guard implemented in PersistentPreRunE or in RunE
// is not visible to Walk.
//
// Probing runs the consumer's own PreRunE implementations, once per reachable
// flag per command, so they must be side-effect-free and cheap: a guard that
// talks to the network, writes a file, or prompts makes walking the tree do the
// same. For the same reason a walk must not run concurrently with other use of
// the same command tree -- Walk leaves the observable tree unchanged, but the
// guards it invokes are consumer code running against a live tree another
// goroutine may be executing.
//
// Three further obligations are on the guard, because Walk cannot enforce any
// of them. A probed guard must return: one that blocks -- on a lock, a read, a
// network call -- wedges Walk with no context, no deadline and nothing to
// cancel. It must not call os.Exit: the calling process dies mid-walk with the
// guard's own status, which in a drift gate reads as an unexplained failure of
// the gate. And it must not call runtime.Goexit, which unwinds past the probe
// and out of the caller's goroutine. The deferred recover around a probe covers
// a panic and nothing else; none of these three is one. A timeout here would
// not help either: it needs a goroutine per probe and still cannot reclaim one
// that has wedged, so the obligation stays where it can actually be met, with
// the guard.
